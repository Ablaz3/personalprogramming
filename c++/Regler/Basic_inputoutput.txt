Streams:
cin  : standad input stream
cout : standard output stream
cerr : standard error output stream
clog : standard logging (output) stream // cerr, and clog are the same as cout, only that they identify the kind of information they are outputting. i.e errors and logs.

Cout : know basics
Cin : Gets information by default from the keyboard. Put >> after cin to insert the information which will be input on the keyboard into a varibale following the >> (extraction operator) Ex: cin >> i; Can also insert into multiple variables by using multiple insertion operators
getline: takes the first argument as the stream, and the second as the variable. 
Stringstream (sstream): converts a string into a stream, or its contents in the applicable scenario. This can be used to insert a strings numerical contents into a integer or float variable. stringstream(string) >> variable;
